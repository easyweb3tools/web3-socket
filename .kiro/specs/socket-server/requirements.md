# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Socket Server project aims to develop a real-time communication middleware service that acts as an intermediary layer between browser clients and the Go backend service. This middleware will handle WebSocket connections using Socket.IO, manage user connections, route messages, and provide a monitoring dashboard. The goal is to reduce the complexity of the Go backend while improving the flexibility and maintainability of real-time communications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Socket.IO Server Implementation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to implement a Socket.IO server that can handle multiple client connections, so that browser clients can establish real-time communication without directly connecting to the Go backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a browser client connects to the server THEN the system SHALL establish a Socket.IO connection.
2. WHEN a client sends a message THEN the system SHALL receive and process it.
3. WHEN the server needs to send a message to a client THEN the system SHALL use the Socket.IO protocol.
4. WHEN multiple clients connect simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle all connections without performance degradation.
5. WHEN a client disconnects THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and update connection status.

### Requirement 2: User Connection Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the middleware to manage user connections and authenticate users, so that messages can be routed to the correct users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects THEN the system SHALL require a registration event with user ID.
2. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL add the connection to a user-specific room (e.g., "user:123").
3. WHEN a user connection is lost THEN the system SHALL detect the disconnection and handle it appropriately.
4. WHEN a user reconnects THEN the system SHALL support automatic reconnection using Socket.IO's built-in mechanisms.
5. IF a connection attempt fails authentication THEN the system SHALL reject the connection.

### Requirement 3: Message Routing

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the middleware to route messages between clients and the Go backend, so that the Go backend doesn't need to implement WebSocket handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends an event THEN the system SHALL forward it to the Go backend via HTTP or message queue.
2. WHEN the Go backend sends a message to the middleware THEN the system SHALL route it to the appropriate client(s).
3. WHEN the Go backend needs to broadcast a message to multiple clients THEN the system SHALL support room-based broadcasting.
4. WHEN routing messages THEN the system SHALL maintain the message format and payload integrity.
5. IF message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt appropriate recovery.

### Requirement 4: HTTP API for Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a Go backend developer, I want an HTTP API to send messages to specific clients, so that I can push updates to users without implementing WebSocket handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Go backend sends a POST request to "/api/push" THEN the system SHALL accept the message and route it to the specified user(s).
2. WHEN receiving a push request THEN the system SHALL validate the request format and authentication.
3. WHEN a push request specifies a user ID THEN the system SHALL deliver the message only to that user.
4. WHEN a push request specifies an event type THEN the system SHALL use that event type when forwarding to clients.
5. IF a push request fails validation THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response.

### Requirement 5: Room Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the middleware to support room-based message routing, so that messages can be efficiently delivered to groups of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects and registers THEN the system SHALL automatically add them to a user-specific room.
2. WHEN the system needs to send a message to a specific user THEN the system SHALL use the user's room.
3. WHEN the system needs to broadcast to multiple users THEN the system SHALL support custom room groupings.
4. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL remove them from all rooms.
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide information about current room memberships.

### Requirement 6: Monitoring Dashboard

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a web dashboard to monitor the Socket.IO server, so that I can track connections, view logs, and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the current number of active connections.
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show a list of active rooms and their members.
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display recent log entries.
4. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show system metrics such as message throughput.
5. WHEN the system status changes THEN the dashboard SHALL update in real-time.

### Requirement 7: Logging and Metrics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and metrics collection, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any significant event occurs THEN the system SHALL log it with appropriate severity level.
2. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL write them to both console and files.
3. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL track connection counts, message counts, and error rates.
4. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL expose metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus.
5. WHEN logs accumulate THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation to manage disk space.

### Requirement 8: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the middleware to implement proper authentication and authorization, so that the system is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects THEN the system SHALL authenticate the connection.
2. WHEN the Go backend sends a push request THEN the system SHALL verify the request's authenticity.
3. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL avoid logging it.
4. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL support JWT or similar token-based authentication.
5. WHEN receiving requests THEN the system SHALL validate input to prevent injection attacks.

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want the middleware to handle errors gracefully and be resilient to failures, so that the system remains stable under adverse conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection error occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection using appropriate backoff strategies.
2. WHEN the system encounters an unexpected error THEN the system SHALL log it and continue operation if possible.
3. WHEN the Go backend is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms.
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN the system SHALL recover its state if applicable.
5. IF the system becomes overloaded THEN the system SHALL implement throttling or load shedding mechanisms.

### Requirement 10: Scalability and Performance

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the middleware to be scalable and performant, so that it can handle growing numbers of connections and messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with multiple instances.
2. WHEN scaled horizontally THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent message delivery using Redis Adapter or similar technology.
3. WHEN handling peak loads THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable performance.
4. WHEN processing messages THEN the system SHALL minimize latency.
5. WHEN designed THEN the system SHALL consider future integration with message brokers like Kafka for further scalability.
